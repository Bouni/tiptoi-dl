# TipToi-dl

A linux CLI TipToi audiofile downloader.

## Motivation

[Ravensburger](https://www.ravensburger.de/), the manufacturer of the famous [TipToi](https://www.ravensburger.de/de-DE/entdecken/tiptoi) offers a Windows and a Mac Program for downloading new audiofiles.
As a Linux user you have to do that [manually via their website](https://service.ravensburger.de/tiptoi%C2%AE/tiptoi%C2%AE_Audiodateien) which is not the best experience.

So I decided to build this little CLI that allows me to download and copy the audiofile for a new book onto my kids TipToi within seconds.

## Usage

```
python tiptoi-dl.py
```
