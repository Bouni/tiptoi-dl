# TipToi-dl

A linux CLI TipTio audiofile downloader.

## Motivation

Ravensburger, the manufacturer of the famous TipToi offers a Windows and a Mac Program for downloading new audiofiles.
As a Linux user you have to do that manually via their website which is not the best experience.

So I decided to build this little CLI that allows me to download and copy the audiofile for a new book onto my kids TipToi within seconds.
